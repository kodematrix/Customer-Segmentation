# Customer Market Segmentation Analysis 

### Key Problems
CRISA has traditionally segmented markets on the basis of purchaser demographics. They would now like to segment the market based on two key sets of variables more directly related to the purchase process and to brand loyalty:
1. Purchase behavior (volume, frequency, susceptibility to discounts, and brand loyalty)
2. Basis of purchase (price, selling proposition)

## Identifying Relationship between Cluster Variables

  ### Customer Purchase

#### Observations:

By observing the parallel plots, we can segment the customers in to 3 categories
      1. Bargain/casual buyers 
      2. Potential customers
      3. Most Valuable Customers

   * The purchase behaviour of cluster 3 can be categorized as Most Valuable Customers to the companies as they are not price sensitive Most of the customers are brand buyers. Females tend to be in long relationship with the company's products.
   * Cluster 1 and 2 shows us a lot of disparities when compared with various parameters. we can categorize cluster 2 as Potential customers based on the number of transactions and total votal volume they bought, There is a huge possibility that the customers could be converted to Most valuble customers. From observing the characteristics of customers variables from cluster 1, they can be classified as casual buyers.

  ### Customer's Basis Of Purchase

*From observing the above plots based on the performance characteristics on Price category and selling proposition variables, we can broadly divide these customers in two three categories*

1. Relationship seekers: This are the type of customers who are intrested in product but not price. Cluster 3 can be classified into this category. Though Cluster 3 not responsive to price category, it responds to most of the selling propositions chosen. Whereas cluster 2 is somewhatresponsive to selling propositions.
        
2. Potential customer: This are the type of customers who seem to be impulsive in making buying decision in an instant, provided that the conditions are right. There is a huge possibility in turning these customers into a longterm relation with the company. Customers in Cluster 2 could be a better fit in to this category based on the characteristics of price and selling proposition variables. 
        
3. Bargain/casual buyers: These are the type of buyers who often stick to one brand/price/selling proposition. rather, these customers would be responsive with the promotions/offers when posted. Customers in cluster 1 could belong to this category.

## Conclusion

* Depending market and customer segmentation, The company should advise strategy to the clients.
* If a company wants to improve brand loyalty.  They must focus on spending resources in implementing advertising and promotions strategies on potential customers rather spending on Most valued customers/Bargain buyers.
* Consumer goods manufacturers should employ effective customer reward system to potential consumers which inevitably increases Brand loyalty, sales and value.
* Bargain buyers can only be swayed by employing effective promotional strategies.
